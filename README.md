# Pewlett Hackard Analysis: Retiring Employees 
With so many employees reaching the age of retirement, it became necessary to determine the quantitiy and rate of expected retiring employees for hiring new employees and developing a mentorship program for veteran employees to teach new employees the skill required for the job.
## Results
### How many employees are ready to retire in the next few years?
* Using the retirement age of roughly 65, it becomes simple to calculate which employees are expected to be retiring from the company. By filtering the data of all employees to include only those with birth dates of 62-65 years ago, a list of retiring employees is quickly created. However, it is necessary to include a filter to remove any employees at retirement age who have already left the company.  
* To understand the impact of this, the data included a "title" column to know which positions would need to be filled. A step further would be to perform a basic statistical analysis to determine which positions are in greater need of replacements and/or if the positions will be filled from within the company, opening up space in other departments. 
### Mentorship Program Elegibility 
* With so many retiring employees and a roughly equal number being hired in the near future, the company though it would be a great idea to have the older employees train on the new ones in a part-time fashion to allow for the retirees to slowly phase-out of the comapny. 
* The code required simply needed to take the retiring employees list that was already produced, and look at the hire date and to date. Doing this offers insight to whether or not the employee has been at the job for long enough to have experience to pass on as well as if they are still at the company.
